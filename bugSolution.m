To address the memory management issue, ensure proper object ownership.  With ARC, use strong properties where appropriate and ensure objects are deallocated correctly.  For manual reference counting, diligently balance `retain` and `release` calls.  Consider using weak references to avoid retain cycles.

For `performSelector`, consider alternatives that are type-safe and offer better exception handling.  If `performSelector` must be used, incorporate thorough error checking to handle potential `selector` not found exceptions gracefully and prevent crashes.

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, weak) NSString *myString; //Weak reference to prevent retain cycle
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = [NSString stringWithString:@"Hello"]; //Use stringWithString for efficiency
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

This revised code avoids potential memory leaks.  Always prefer safer alternatives to `performSelector` when possible to improve code robustness and maintainability.
