In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regard to object ownership and the `retain`/`release` cycle (or its modern equivalent using ARC).  Consider this example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

If `someMethod` is called multiple times, or if `myString` is not properly managed (e.g., during object deallocation), it will lead to memory leaks or crashes. Another subtle issue is in using `performSelector` without careful attention to object lifecycles and potential `selector` not found runtime exceptions.
